Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.

Basic operations supported by an array are as stated below :−
=============================================================

1. Traverse − print all the array elements one by one.
2. Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.
3. Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.
4. Search − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
5. Update − Updates an element at the given index.

Array is created in Python by importing array module to the python program. Then, the array is declared as shown below −

from array import *
arrayName = array(typecode, [Initializers])

Typecode	Value
b	        Represents signed integer of size 1 byte
B	        Represents unsigned integer of size 1 byte
c	        Represents character of size 1 byte
i	        Represents signed integer of size 2 bytes
I	        Represents unsigned integer of size 2 bytes
f	        Represents floating point of size 4 bytes
d	        Represents floating point of size 8 bytes

Two dimanesional arrays
=======================

Two dimensional array is an array within an array. It is an array of arrays.
In this type of array the position of an data element is referred by two indices instead of one. So it represents a table with rows an dcolumns of data.

Matrix
======

Matrix is a special case of two dimensional array where each data element is of strictly same size. So every matrix is also a two dimensional array but not vice versa.
Matrices are very important data structures for many mathematical and scientific calculations.
